# StockExplain 🧠📈

## What is StockExplain?
StockExplain is a web-based platform that helps Indian retail investors
understand why a stock price moved on a particular day.

Instead of showing only charts and numbers, the platform explains
price movements using simple language by analyzing market trends,
company news, trading volume, and sentiment.

## Problem Statement

not understand the reasons behind daily price movements.
